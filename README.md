# Persistence Homology: Applications to Time Series and Knot Theory

This repository contains the Python and MATLAB implementations developed for the study **‚ÄúApplications of Persistent Homology to Time Series and Knot Theory‚Äù**.  
The main goal of this work is to explore how persistent homology (PH) captures topological features in temporal and geometric data, and to investigate the correlations between PH quantities and the geometric structures of knot embeddings.

## üîç Overview


1. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Uses **sliding window embeddings** (Perea & Harer, 2015)  
   - Computes 1-dimensional persistence to verify periodicity  
   - Implements an interactive MATLAB GUI for parameter tuning and visualization  

2. **Knot Theory**  
   - Applies PH to polygonal knot embeddings  
   - Studies the relation between **geometric quantities** (e.g., injectivity radius, curvature, torsion) and **PH-based topological indicators**  
   - Inspired by Celoria & Mahler (2022), *A statistical approach to knot confinement via persistent homology*
